Example STM32H743ZI firmware setup
==================================

This repo contains everything needed to compile firmware for an STM32H743ZI Nucleo 144 board
using standard tools like GCC, GDB and Make.

BlackMagicProbe or JLINK debugger probes are expected to flash the firmware,
but make-targets to do that are provided.
